# Car sharing

Allows to simulate carsharing modes like station based (one-way, round-trip) or freefloating.  The main features of the current state are:  * Different companies providing carsharing services
 * Flexible cost structures per company and per mode
 * Membership per operator and per mode
 * Infrastructure for models that let people decide should they keep their vehicles during activities
 * Infrastructure for models that let people decide from which operator should they rent a vehicle (in case they are members of more than 1)
 * Vehicles infrastructure is flexible allowing easy implementation of special vehicles (e.g. electrical) * More convenient output 
 * Input is completely separated from default MATSim files (just the config file has to be adapted now)
 * (Easy) integration with other modes
